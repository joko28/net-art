        <h2>Artist Statement</h2>
        <p>
          In today’s fast-paced, digital world, the stillness of nature often
          goes unnoticed. My project, <strong>“Frames of Reflection”</strong>,
          seeks to recapture these fleeting moments of beauty and reflection by
          combining photography and poetry. This interactive experience invites
          viewers to explore the emotional impact that arises when visuals and
          words come together—two art forms that, when paired, inspire deeper
          thought.
        </p>
        <p>
          By merging a curated selection of nature photography with short,
          poetic lines, each “frame” becomes a window into a quiet,
          introspective world. Nature’s subtle whispers—from rustling leaves to
          the soft glow of the moon—are expressed through minimalist poetry. The
          random combinations create a continuously changing experience, with
          each click offering a new perspective, reminding us that our
          relationship with the natural world shifts, just as our inner selves
          do.
        </p>
        <p>
          At its heart, <strong>“Frames of Reflection”</strong> celebrates
          nature’s ability to inspire calm and wonder, even in its smallest
          details. It invites us to slow down, reconnect with our senses, and
          find poetry in the everyday. Through this project, I aim to create a
          digital space where art becomes a form of meditation, offering a
          peaceful escape from the noise of modern life.
